**Better DND Beyond Currency** is an add-on based on the new WebExtensions technology
and targeted to *Firefox* and *Chrome* based browsers.

This extension adjusts how currency is calculated on DND Beyond
so that coins of higher value will be changed into lower value coins
when you remove more of the lower value coin than you have.
